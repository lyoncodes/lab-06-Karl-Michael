**Author**: Karl Polintan (Nav), Michael Lyons (Drive)
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Make the back-end API for the City Explorer website, integrating location and weather information, getting them ready for related APIs later on.

## Getting Started
Start a server.js file, assign proper dependencies (cors, express).

## Architecture
This application utilizes geo.json for location data and darksky.json for weather information. The idea is likely linking the actual APIs to this backend later on.

## Change Log
12-06-2018 9:30pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
Got help from TA Ix Procopios and Nicholas C.!
